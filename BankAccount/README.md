# Java Bank Accounts Application

A Tutorial on Java object oriented Menu Driven application that demonstrates  Inheritance,  Is-a Relationship and Polymorphism

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Java Inheritance: Is-a Relationship:
-------------------------------------------------------
Is-a relationship indicates that A class Is a subclass of another class. Is-a relationship promotes code reuse that is the basic advantage of Object Oriented Programming. 

For example: A Person is a base class, A Student is a subclass. Now the student is a Person also. 

Polymorphism provides another advantage where child classes can override the base class methods and provide their own functionality.
